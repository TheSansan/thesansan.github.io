				<h2>First Site Project for Class</h2>
				<div class="webC">
					<h3> This is my first site project for class. It's for a local dentist office in downtown Greenville.<br><br>

I did a lot of research about the dentist office before starting the site. I made a client interview template, competitive Market study, and content stategy.<br><br>

After that I did wireframes and 3 different styletiles in Illustrator, and then I chose the styletile of the three that I thought stood out the most.<br><br>

And then I learned HTML and CSS in class. I coded the wireframes and styletiles in HTML and CSS.

And this is the site that I built.<br><br>

I also make a logo for the dentist in Illustrator, and created line art from a falls park picture for the site header in photoshop.</h3><br>
