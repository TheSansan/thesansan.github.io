				<h2>First Site Project for Class</h2>
				<div class="webC">
					<h3> This is my first site project for class. It's for a local dentist office in downtown Greenville.<br><br>

I did a lot of research about the dentist office before starting the site. I made a client interview template, competitive Market study, and content strategy.<br><br>

After that I did wireframes and 3 different style tiles in Illustrator, and then I chose the styletile of the three that I thought stood out the most.<br><br>

And then I learned HTML and CSS in class. I coded the wireframes and styletiles in HTML and CSS.

And this is the site that I built.<br><br>

I also made a logo for the dentist in Illustrator, and created line art from a falls park picture for the site header in photoshop.</h3><br>

	     	<h2>Final Project for Class<h2>
	     		<div class="webC">
	     			<h3> This is my final project for class. It was to redesign Starbucks's website.<br><br>
	     				Their original website is a nice, modern website with cool functionality.

But its not very personal. <br><br> 

But Starbucks's original goal was to be, what they called, the third place: Home. Work. Starbucks.  A place where people can meet friends, relax, and enjoy their coffee.<br><br>

So I wanted to focus on bringing this personal feel back to Starbucks by making their website more welcoming.<br><br>I used blue and creamy tan colors, and several images of people enjoying Starbucks to give the site a friendly, welcoming feeling on the home page.
I also made a community page for people sharing their personal stories and experiences involving Starbucks.<br><br>

 I also wanted to draw attention to Starbucks's growing tea business, because I don't think that many people think of Starbucks as a tea company, even though it is becoming a larger and larger part of their business.  So I made a tea page for this project.<br><br>
 Just like how I wanted users to share their stories and memories with Starbucks, I wanted Starbucks to have a place to share their story with their customers. So I made a About us page for this project.<br><br>
  To emphasize Starbucks's long history I used black and white pictures, a design that I used throughout the site.  I didn't just want to give the site a friendly, welcoming feeling, but also a bit of a nostalgic feeling to bring back memories that the people have had at Starbucks, as a way to bring up the special connection between Starbucks and its customers.<br><br>

This connection between Starbucks and the Customer was the main idea behind my design for the website, and I hope that it shows when you look at my site.</h3><br>
