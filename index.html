					    <p> My name is San, and I'm from China. I've always been interested in different languages and cultures since I was a little kid. So after I graduated from college. I went to Japan to study Japanese for 2 years. There, I met my husband. About 2 and half years ago I moved to Greenville SC with my husband, started my new life here.
					    </p> 
					    <br><br>
				   
                        <p>I've always been busy in my life. But when I just got to America, I didn't know how to drive, I didn't know much English, I felt like my whole world suddenly slowed down. But because of that, I got time to think what I want to do, and who I am. </p>
                        <br></br>
             
                        <p>I started trying to do something that I usually don't do, like painting and sketching. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed doing these things! Then I got a chance to do some art design work for an iPad game. And about 1 year ago I got to plan for my whole wedding, and I designed my own wedding programs. </p>
                    <br><br>
              
                   	    <p>I felt like something was growing inside my mind, and one day I told my husband, "I want to be a designer." He was not suprised at all, and he said that he always knew I wanted to do it and he believed I'd be good at it.</p>
                   <br><br>
           
                   	    <p>There are always big changes in my life, but deciding to be a designer is definitely the most excting one, I feel like that's where my passion is. And taking the Iron Yard Web Design Couse has been the most challenging experience in my life. I've learned photoshop, Illustator, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Git, and design principles in just 2 months. I feel like I'm no longer just wanting to be a designer, but I'm actually being one now!</p>

                        <p>Design is everywhere in my life, but my story as a designer just begun.</p>

					<h2>The Seventh Week at The Iron Yard</h2>
					<div class="col1">
					<p> I have to say it's been a tough week for me. I learned iTerm, GitHub, Sass, and MarkDown in 3 days at class. That was a lot! 
But I get to learn a lot from the class everyday, and I think that is the beauty of the Iron Yard courses.<br><br>

I got very frustrated and stressed out this week because I thought I understood everything in class, but when I did my homework on Wednesday, I was totally lost and couldn't even begin to figure out what was wrong. To be honest I was scared, because usually when I run to a problem, I always can find a way to figure it out, even though sometimes it takes a lot of time. But this time I just didn't know where to start and how to help myself. And it was the first time I didn't finish my homework by 9 in the morning. I was pretty upset about myself.<br><br>

But fortunately the negative attitude didn't stay very long, I got some help from one of my classmates and my teacher Sam the next day. Everything just magically started making sense again. I went back to a I CAN DO IT mood pretty quickly after that.<br><br>

The class won't cover everything, but I believe by the day I finish the class I'll be confident to tell myself " Ok, I don't know how to do it right now, but I'll find a way to learn how to do it, and then do it! " I think that's a powerful skill to have in my life!</p>
