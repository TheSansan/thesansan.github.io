					<p>It doesnt't matter where you are from,<br> it doesn't matter what language you speak,<br> design allows you to express who you are.

					    <p> My name is San, and I'm from China. I've always been interested in different languages and cultures since I was a little kid. So after I graduated from college. I went to Japan to study Japanese for 2 years. There, I met my husband. About 2 and half years ago I moved to Greenville SC with my husband, started my new life here.

                        <p>I've always been busy in my life. But when I just got to America, I didn't know how to drive, I didn't know much English, I felt like my whole world suddenly slowed down. But because of that, I got time to think what I want to do, and who I am. </p>
                        <br></br>

                  <div class="col1">
                        <p>I started trying to do something that I usually don't do, like painting and sketching. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed doing these things! Then I got a chance to do some art design work for an iPad game. And about 1 year ago I got to plan for my whole wedding, and I designed my own wedding programs. </p>

                   <div class="col1">
                   	    <p>I felt like something was growing inside my mind, and one day I told my husband, "I want to be a designer." He was not suprised at all, and he said that he always knew I wanted to do it and he believed I'd be good at it.</p>
                   <br><br>

                   <div class="col1">
                   	    <p>There are always big changes in my life, but deciding to be a designer is definitely the most excting one, I feel like that's where my passion is. And taking the Iron Yard Web Design Couse has been the most challenging experience in my life. I've learned photoshop, Illustator, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Git, and design principles in just 2 months. I feel like I'm no longer just wanting to be a designer, but I'm actually being one now!</p>
